weather api

I wanted to get some practice with using a fetch api call. I found the documentation quite easy to use on the openweather website. 
I struggled with th appid until I saw a post on stackoverflow that said it takes a few hours to for appid to be activated. 
overall it was a good experience and i enjoyed putting it together. I still cant believe the openweather api is actaully free to use.
